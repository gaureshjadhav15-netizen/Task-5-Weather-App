🌤️ Weather Web Application

This project is a Weather Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to fetch real-time weather data based on their current location or a user-specified location.
The app displays important weather information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more, in a clean and user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features
📍 Location-Based Weather: Automatically detects the user's current location to fetch weather data.
🏙️ Search by City: Users can input a city or location to view weather information.
🌡️ Current Weather Display: Shows temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and other details.
🎨 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
⚡ Real-Time Data: Fetches live weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

🧩 Technologies Used
HTML5 → Structure of the web page and input fields.
CSS3 → Styling and layout for an attractive UI.
JavaScript (ES6) → Fetches API data, updates the DOM, and handles user input.
Weather API → OpenWeatherMap API (or any other free API) to retrieve real-time weather information.

🧠 How It Works
User Location Detection:
Uses the browser’s navigator.geolocation API to get the current coordinates.
Sends coordinates to the weather API to fetch data.
Search by City:
Users can enter a city name in the search input.
The app makes a request to the weather API with the entered city and displays the results.
Data Display:
Temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon are displayed dynamically.
Error handling if the location is invalid or the API request fails.
